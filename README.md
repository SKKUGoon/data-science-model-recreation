# Basic tool for data science

**Objective: Study the theoretical / intuition behind each models.
If the model can be made without using the package, recreate them**

## Preparation List

| Objective | Low Tier Model | High Tier Model |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Regression | Ridge / LASSO | LightGBM |
| Classification | Logistic / SVM | LightGBM |
| Clustering | K-means | HDBSCAN |
| Feature Reduction | PCA | UMAP |
